## Problem Statement: 
In this problem, NYC TAXI demand dataset is provided and our objective is to predict the number of pickups in the region in the next 10mins. If we predict the number of pickups then TAXI can able to make decision for the region.

## Objectives & Constriants:
End-User: Taxi Driver [Smartphone]

### Objective: Predict the number of pickups as accurately as possible for each region in a 10-min interval.

### Constraints: 
-  Latency: Times take to predict the number of pickups. Few seconds is okay to provide the result to taxi-driver
-  Interpretability: The number of pickups need not be very accurate, as the result will provide the rough idea for the TAXI driver for the pickups in next 10mins.
-  Relative Errors: Predicting the pickups, we need to consider the percentage error or relative errors.
