# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Python and Jupyter notebooks.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

## Problem Statement: In this problem, NYC TAXI demand dataset is provided and our objective is to predict the number of pickups in the region in the next 10mins. If we predict the number of pickups then TAXI can able to make decision for the region.

## Objectives & Constriants:
End-User: Taxi Driver [Smartphone]

Objective: Predict the number of pickups as accurately as possible for each region in a 10-min interval.

Constraints: 
1. Latency: Times take to predict the number of pickups. Few seconds is okay to provide the result to taxi-driver
2. Interpretability: The number of pickups need not be very accurate, as the result will provide the rough idea for the TAXI driver for the pickups in next 10mins.
3. Relative Errors: Predicting the pickups, we need to consider the percentage error or relative errors.
